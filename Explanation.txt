The first step of the program is to read the input array. The row is splitted by spaces, only the even numbers get selected
and the duplicates are removed. Then the program runs a for-loop to find the combinations for single, double up to n-th groups
where "n" is the count of the even numbers in the array. For example, if all the even numbers are {2, 4, 6, 8} it starts
with counting all the single subsets: {2}, {4}, {6}, {8}. Then, the double subsets: {2, 4}, {2, 6} and so on up to the
length of the array, in the instance - 4. The counting itself is done with the mathematical formula for combination:
n! / [k!*(n-k)!] where "n" is the number of elements and "k" is the length of the subset.
